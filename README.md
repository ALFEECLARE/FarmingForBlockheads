# Farming for Blockheads
Minecraft Mod. Adds farming utilities, such as a seed market, fertilizer and feeding troughs.

See [the license](LICENSE) for modpack permissions etc.

This mod is available for both Forge and Fabric (starting Minecraft 1.17). This is a trial run to see if supporting both
platforms is feasible.

## Custom Market Entries

Data packs are now used to configure the market. You can place JSON files inside a `farmingforblockheads_compat` folder (so the resulting path would be `data/<domain>/farmingforblockheads_compat/{files}.json`) within a datapack which will be loaded. For simple scenarios, you can also use the `MarketRegistry.json` file under `config/farmingforblockheads/MarketRegistry.json`.

See here for an example:Â https://gist.github.com/blay09/93a48d092d6dc570a64c81e1912dc4d0

## Java API

If the IMC API is not enough for you, you can build against Farming for Blockheads' Java API.
The Java API allows everything the IMC API does, and certain tasks can only be achieved via the Java API.
However, if you don't need that extra control, it is recommended to use the IMC API.
