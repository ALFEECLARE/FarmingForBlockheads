## Custom Market Entries

Data packs are now used to configure the market. You can place JSON files inside a `farmingforblockheads_compat`
folder (so the resulting path would be `data/<namespace>/farmingforblockheads_compat/{files}.json`) within a datapack which
will be loaded. For simple scenarios, you can also use the `MarketRegistry.json` file
under `config/farmingforblockheads/MarketRegistry.json`.

## IMC API

The below is a list of IMC messages handled by Farming for Blockheads.

* **RegisterMarketCategory** (NBT)
    * RegistryName (String) - Resource location, must be prefixed with your mod id!
    * Tooltip (String) - Should be the language key for the tooltip
    * Texture (String) - Resource location to the texture sheet for your category icon
    * TextureX (Integer) - X coordinate of the icon on the texture sheet (icons must be 20x20)
    * TextureY (Integer) - Y coordinate of the icon on the texture sheet (icons must be 20x20)
* **RegisterMarketEntry** (NBT)
    * OutputItem (ItemStack)
    * CostItem (ItemStack)
    * Category (String) - Resource location, must be a registered category. Default categories
      are `farmingforblockheads:seeds`, `farmingforblockheads:saplings` and `farmingforblockheads:other`

## Java API

If the IMC API is not enough for you, you can build against Farming for Blockheads' Java API.
The Java API allows everything the IMC API does, and certain tasks can only be achieved via the Java API.
However, if you don't need that extra control, it is recommended to use the IMC API.

## Adding Farming for Blockheads to a development environment

Note that you will also need to add Balm if you want to test your integration in your environment.

### Using CurseMaven

Add the following to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url "https://www.cursemaven.com" }
}

dependencies {
    // Replace ${farmingforblockheads_file_id} and ${balm_file_id} with the id of the file you want to depend on.
    // You can find it in the URL of the file on CurseForge (e.g. 3914527).
    // Forge: implementation fg.deobf("curse.maven:balm-531761:${balm_file_id}")
    // Fabric: modImplementation "curse.maven:balm-fabric-500525:${balm_file_id}"
    
    // Forge: implementation fg.deobf("curse.maven:farming-for-blockheads-261924:${farmingforblockheads_file_id}")
    // Fabric: modImplementation "curse.maven:farming-for-blockheads-fabric-554586:${farmingforblockheads_file_id}"
}
```

### Using Twelve Iterations Maven (includes snapshot and mojmap versions)

Add the following to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy

    maven { 
        url "https://maven.twelveiterations.com/repository/maven-public/" 
        
        content {
            includeGroup "net.blay09.mods"
        }
    }
}

dependencies {
    // Replace ${farmingforblockheads_version} and ${balm_version} with the version you want to depend on. 
    // You can find the latest version for a given Minecraft version at https://maven.twelveiterations.com/service/rest/repository/browse/maven-public/net/blay09/mods/balm-common/ and https://maven.twelveiterations.com/service/rest/repository/browse/maven-public/net/blay09/mods/farmingforblockheads-common/
    // Common (mojmap): implementation "net.blay09.mods:balm-common:${balm_version}"
    // Forge: implementation fg.deobf("net.blay09.mods:balm-forge:${balm_version}")
    // Fabric: modImplementation "net.blay09.mods:balm-fabric:${balm_version}"
    
    // Common (mojmap): implementation "net.blay09.mods:farmingforblockheads-common:${farmingforblockheads_version}"
